Enter in your city of choice and select search to view the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index for that city at the current time. Upon the search, the dashobard will also display the weather, temperature and hummidity forecast for the next five(5) days.

UV Index will be accompanied by a color indicating the severity of the index. Favorable is shown in green, Moderate is shown in yellow, and severe is shown in red.
